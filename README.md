# Natural Language Processing with Python

_A humanistic consortium for code review and exercises._

In order to **practice using GitHub**, as well as because it is a very useful tool for **collaboratively working on code**,
we'll be using GitHub for submitting exercises and doing code reviews.

As a collaborator you can push your submissions to the repository, I can comment on your code, and we can keep track
of all changes through version control, and order in our code. :)
