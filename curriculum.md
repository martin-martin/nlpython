# Objectives

### General objectives

fluency in getting, cleaning, analyzing and presenting data

### Current objectives

1. A solid grasp on the basics of python.
2. Literacy in
    * getting data from the web using web scraping and APIs
    * processing unstructured text data using NLP and ML tools
    * simple presentation of analysis results via jupyter notebooks and github

# Curriculum

- python basics
- python intermediate
- web scraping (bs4, scrapy, selenium)
- analyze new packages (e.g. spaCy) to find out which ones to focus on
- using APIs to fetch information (e.g. social media analysis: tweepy, etc.)
- working with jupyter notebooks, pandas, matplotlib, numpy etc.
- data cleaning
- common text analysis tools and approaches
    * NLP (topic modeling, sentiment analysis, TF-IDF, entity recognition, PoS)
    * ML (LSTM, PCA, etc.)
- intro to scikit-learn (e.g. SVM, random forests)
- regexp

## Project brainstorming

* topic model over the past years of the Yale president's speeches (did he become more strict or remain warm and fuzzy? üêá)
* test a hypothesis on student satisfaction - do they find challenging courses more satisfying? aggregate all student reviews and assess correlation between how easy is the course perceived and student satisfaction
* ... and way more :) ...

# Support types

- task assignment (e.g. chapter x of book y)
- daily personal video chat meetings during the week
    - general discussion
        * thinking aloud on questions
        * discussing concepts
        * screen sharing when coding together
    - live quizzing ("I'll quiz you on __topic__ by __time__.")
        * identifies common mistakes or misunderstandings
        * helps with training problem solving skills
        * provides accountability for the inputs received
        * keeps it entertaining! :)
- weekends for project work
    * code reviews for projects built
- message support (slack or email)
- (optional, if need be) screen recordings
    * Martin: to show some concepts that you can easily re-watch
    * Casey: to show me how you code so I can identify areas of improvement

**emphasis on personalized pointers to build on top of learned content to develop specific skills**

```

# Support frequency

- 5 video chat sessions per week (~1hr each)
- code review and suggestions for one larger project per week
- quick small-scale support over slack when need arises. I should be able to
    get back to you either right away or within the day
- screen recordings per requirement (if we identify smth. that remains unclear
    or needs more training)

# Schedule

**start:** 2018-06-29 -> 2018-08-31 **:end**

- Course time: 9 weeks
    * 2 weeks for learning fundamentals + 1 week of refinement
    * 6 weeks of project-oriented learning
- Casey
    * 3-4hrs/day coding, ramp it up over the course of the course of the course of the course...
    * 24/7 immersion! :)
- Martin
    * ca. 2hrs/day 5days/week (split up between live sessions and preparation)
    * 5 hrs/week code review and curriculum/project preparation

# Cost

Billed hourly at $35/hr for mentor/tutor services. If we follow the estimated
time projection mentioned above, this amounts to $4725 for the 9 week option.
My time will be clearly tracked, and payments can happen on a bi-weekly basis.
Like this we can adjust as needed moving forward (e.g. if we see that more or less support time is needed).
