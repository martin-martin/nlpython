- __repr__() method and __str__() method instead of print() calls

- add two planets:
     * Earth
     * Another Earth
     (ps.: what are two different ways of doing this, considering their nature?)


- do the 'another earth' example with classes using Inheritance

def MirrorPlanet(Planet):

    def __init__(*args)
        super().__init__(*args)


- include the format_name() function as a method in the composer class
- alternatively: import it as a module
