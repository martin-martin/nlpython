# The __init__() function
# so in the last exercise we created this class planet. And based on this
# class, we created an object , which had all these attributes and a method
# as well. But we said if we created a new instance, it would have all the same
# property values.
# So what's the point of creating multiple instances?

    # we need to implement another dunder method: __eq__()
    # this is another nice example that gives us a view through the
